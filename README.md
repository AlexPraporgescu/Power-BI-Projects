1. Project Overview

This project is based on a real survey data from more than 600 data professionals who answered several questions on LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. The survey dataset was obtained from [Alex The Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst).
The aim of the project was to investigate the data job market through the eyes of data professionals, regarding some key aspects such as: dificulty to break into data domain, average salary for different job titles, happiness with work-life balance,
happiness with salary and more.

2. Data Preparation and Cleaning

In order to prepare the data for analysis, I performed the following operations on the dataset (using Power Querry):
 - Removed the columns that were not relevant to the analysis.
 - Bracketed the job title, favourite programming language, working insdustry and living country columns in order to simplify the analysis.
 - Constructed an average yearly salary column.

2. Data Analysis

The analysis of the dataset was done by using the following tools available in Power BI:
 - Treemap.
 - Cards.
 - Pie charts.
 - Donuts charts.
 - Bar chart.
 - Gauges.
 - Clustered column chart.

3. Key Findings

 - The majority of the respondents switched into data from other professional domains.
 - Only 31.8% of the respondents consider that it is difficult or very difficut to break into data.
 - Favourite programming language of the majority is Python, especially for Data Analysts.
 - A possible problem could be the happiness with the salary, which registered an average score of 4.27 out of 10, which is below average.
