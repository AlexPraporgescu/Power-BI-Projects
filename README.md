1. Project Overview

This project is based on a real survey data from more than 600 data professionals who answered several questions on LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. The survey dataset was obtained from [Alex The Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst).
The aim of the project was to investigate the data job market through the eyes of data professionals, regarding some key aspects such as: dificulty to break into data domain, average salary for different job titles, happiness with work-life balance,
happiness with salary and more.

2. Data Preparation and Cleaning

In order to prepare the data for analysis, I performed the following operations on the dataset (using Power Querry):
 - Removed the columns that were not relevant to the analysis.
 - Bracketed the job title, favourite programming language, working insdustry and living country columns in order to simplify the analysis.
 - Constructed an average yearly salary column.

3. Data Analysis

The analysis of the dataset was done by using the following tools available in Power BI:
 - Treemap.
 - Cards.
 - Pie charts.
 - Donuts charts.
 - Bar chart.
 - Gauges.
 - Clustered column chart.

4. Key Findings

 - The majority of the respondents switched into data from other professional domains.
 - Only 31.8% of the respondents consider that it is difficult or very difficut to break into data.
 - Favourite programming language of the majority is Python, especially for Data Analysts.
 - A possible problem could be the happiness with the salary, which registered an average score of 4.27 out of 10, which is below average.

1. Project Overview

The goal is to analyze the Google Playstore Apps dataset to derive insights into the app market.
I aim to understand the factors that contribute to an app's success, including its user ratings, reviews, and category.
I want to explore user sentiments towards apps by analyzing the user reviews dataset.
Additionally, insights into the popularity of app categories based on the total number of installs and the sentiment polarity of user reviews can be seen.
The ultimate objective is to provide recommendations for app developers to enhance their app's performance and user satisfaction.

2. Data Preparation and Cleaning

Data preparation and cleaning was done using MySQL. A detailed walkthrough of the preparation and cleaning steps can be found [here]([++++++++++++](https://github.com/AlexPraporgescu/SQL-Google-Playstore-Analysis)).

3. Data Analysis

The analysis of the dataset was done by using the following tools available in Power BI:
 - Cards.
 - Bar charts.
 - Donut charts.
 - Line graphs.
 - Tables.
 - Slicers (for creating the interactive dashboard).

4. Key Findings

Some of the most important insights are:
 - The app category with the best average rating is the personalization category having an average rating of 4.34.
 - The apps categories with the highest number of installs are game followed by communication and productivity.
 - The category that contains the most apps is family.
 - The category with the most positive sentiments is personalization.

  ### <ins>Notes</ins>

- These projects represent my practice work in the field of data analysis. The data used may no longer be relevant and therefore the findings should be treated in accordance.
